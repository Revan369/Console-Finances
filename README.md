# Console-Finances
this repo is for a challenge using javascript
 
for this task i was given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.

i was asked to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset.

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

finally it should print the analysis to the console. when the code is opened in the browser the resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86

Total: $38382578

Average Change: -2315.12

Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)

Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)






here is a link to the page where you can see the result of my solution in the console log using the inspect element command...
